For example, a manager wants to present a proposal for a new marketing strategy to a company's board of directors. Using the Minto Pyramid Principle, the manager would organize the proposal in the following way:

                                Increase Sales
                                   /   |   \
                             Improve Brand Awareness 
                                           |
                                      Target New Demographics

In this example, the main idea of the proposal is "Increase Sales", which is at the top of the pyramid. The sub-ideas that support this main idea are "Improve Brand Awareness" and "Target New Demographics". This structure shows how each sub-idea is related to the main idea and how they all work together to achieve the goal of increasing sales.
